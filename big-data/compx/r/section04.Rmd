This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# Cars Test

```{r}
summary(cars)
```
```{r}
ggplot(cars, aes(dist)) +
  geom_histogram()
```
```{r}
cars %>%
  mutate(logdist=log10(dist + 1)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(logdist)) + 
  geom_histogram()
```
```{r}
cars %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=dist, y=speed)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```

```{r}
library(caret)

bc <- BoxCoxTrans(cars$speed,cars$dist)
bc
```

```{r}
tcars <- mutate(cars, TransformedSpeed = predict(bc, cars$speed))

ggplot(tcars,aes(x=dist, y=TransformedSpeed)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()
```

# z-score

\[ z = \frac{x - \bar{x}}{s} \]

z = (x - mean) / sd

```{r}
data_mean = 29.314
data_sd = 73.376

player_goals = 1360
player_z = (player_goals - data_mean) / data_sd
player_z
```
# PCA

```{r}
install.packages("mlbench")
library(mlbench)
data(BreastCancer)
```
```{r}
BreastCancer <- as_tibble(BreastCancer)
BreastCancer
```

```{r}
BreastCancer <- na.omit(BreastCancer)
predictors <- BreastCancer %>% select(Cl.thickness:Mitoses)
predictors 
```

```{r}
predictors <- predictors %>% mutate_all( ~as.numeric(.) )
predictors
```

```{r}
PCA <- princomp(predictors, scores = TRUE)
BreastCancer$PC1 <- PCA$scores[,1]
BreastCancer$PC2 <- PCA$scores[,2]

ggplot(BreastCancer,aes(PC1, PC2)) +
geom_point(aes(col = Class))
```
